# Accelerating drug discovery through active learning - enhanced virtual screening

Project Objective: 
Applying traditional structure-based virtual screening in an exhaustive manner is increasingly cost-prohibitive in the process of drug discovery, so we would implement active learning-enhanced virtual screening, which could dramatically increase throughput over traditional virtual screening. Specifically in this project, ATOM Modeling Pipeline(APML) is implemented to identify those structures which are most likely to bind to a drug target.
